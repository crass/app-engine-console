Bugs
====

* The last expression value, '_', is not set
* Probably should send data via HTTP POST
* Refactor out all the unused code from the Javascript

Features
========

* Sessions
* Authentication and authorization
* Allow the developer to define a module with utility functions they like that
  will load up into the current namespace
* Support a different Python context per session, with the ability for people
  to share contexts if they want
* Probably need to implement contexts the way Google's "shell" app does since
  it looks like InteractiveInterpreter is not easily pickleable.
* History saving across page reloads
* See if IPython is pure-python and if so, maybe use it as the back-end
* Maybe some sort of pastebin integration
* Maybe talkinator integration
