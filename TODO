Bugs
====

* Deleting an unpicklable from the session does not work
* Whitespace-only output (e.g. print "   ") doesn't come out right
* Put stuff in the Help and About page
  * What all the settings do
  * Where to find the code
  * How to integrate it in your own app, maybe with some kind of walkthrough
  * Tested in FF only

Features
========

* More RESTful architecture
* The ability for people to share contexts if they want
* History saving across page reloads
* See if IPython is pure-python and if so, maybe use it as the back-end
* logging integration
* Perhaps a emacs/readline-style interface (^A, ^E, ^U, ^K) at the prompt
* Maybe return a 404 in production mode for non-admins, so people can't tell
  that it is installed
