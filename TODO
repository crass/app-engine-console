Bugs
====

* Do not write to the DB until a user logs in.  Currently merely hitting the
  front page creates a new session in the DB.  Perhaps memcache it until they
  are granted their first statement?
* Standard module links do not work in production mode
* Deleting an unpicklable from the session does not work
* Probably should send data via HTTP POST
* Refactor out all the unused code from the Javascript
* Logging the email of the user who runs every command
* Whitespace-only output (e.g. print "   ") doesn't come out right
* Put stuff in the Help and About page
  * What all the settings do
  * Where to find the code
  * How to integrate it in your own app, maybe with some kind of walkthrough

Features
========

* The ability for people to share contexts if they want
* History saving across page reloads
* See if IPython is pure-python and if so, maybe use it as the back-end
* logging integration
