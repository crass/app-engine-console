Features
========

* Maybe cache the pages in the Help tab in memcache or the data store

  the license are at the top-level
* Make a script to package up a zip file from a tag
* More RESTful architecture
* The ability for people to share contexts if they want
* History saving across page reloads
* See if IPython is pure-python and if so, maybe use it as the back-end

* Perhaps a emacs/readline-style interface (^A, ^E, ^U, ^K) at the prompt
* Special behavior for the console site itself:
  * A simple form to submit feedback
