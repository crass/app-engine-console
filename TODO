Bugs
====

* Dynamic height of the console, supporting small and large resolution
* Deleting things from the session does not work
* Should support full-height in the cleanest way possible
  * Test against 1024x600 to simulate an Eee
  * Maybe test against whatever the iPhone is

Features
========

* Chrome and Safari support (20% and 8% of the visits respectively)
* Maybe cache the pages in the Help tab in memcache or the data store
* Make a script to package up a zip file from a tag
* More RESTful architecture
* The ability for people to share contexts if they want
* History saving across page reloads
* logging integration
* Perhaps a emacs/readline-style interface (^A, ^E, ^U, ^K) at the prompt
* Some sort of GData integration
* Update to the latest Pygments

Wishlist
========

* Integration with unittest to run unit tests server-side
* Autocompletion
