Bugs
====

* Do not write to the DB until a user logs in.  Currently merely hitting the
  front page creates a new session in the DB.  Perhaps memcache it until they
  are granted their first statement?
* Deleting an unpicklable from the session does not work
* Whitespace-only output (e.g. print "   ") doesn't come out right
* Put stuff in the Help and About page
  * What all the settings do
  * Where to find the code
  * How to integrate it in your own app, maybe with some kind of walkthrough
  * Tested in FF only

Features
========

* More RESTful architecture
* The ability for people to share contexts if they want
* History saving across page reloads
* See if IPython is pure-python and if so, maybe use it as the back-end
* logging integration
* Port the Javascript to jQuery
* Perhaps a emacs/readline-style interface (^A, ^E, ^U, ^K) at the prompt
