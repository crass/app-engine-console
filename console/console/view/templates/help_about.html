    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        App Engine Console, from <a href="http://www.proven-corporation.com/">Proven Corporation</a>,
        is a tool to aid development on Google App Engine. It is a traditional
        interactive Python session running in the server, which you use from a web browser.  It
        is designed to be embedded within other applications to allow convenient testing, debugging,
        and maintenance.  App Engine Console has the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A browser-based console</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Just like running Python interactively from the command line</li>
                <li>Optional syntax highlighting</li>
                <li>Exceptions, modules, and types link to their own documentation on python.org</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Convenience</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy access to the datastore viewer and application dashboard</li>
                <li>Pastebin integration</li>
                <li>Instant messaging between team members</li>
                <li>Automatically imports an <tt>autoexec.py</tt> module, to which you may add your own useful functions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Only site administrators may use the console when in production</li>
                <li>Optionally return HTTP 404 for non-authorized users (hiding the console from public view)</li>
                <li>Logs the email address, statements, and output of all commands from all users</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

        you will raise a very droll exception with a link to log in. (<strong>Note:</strong>
        App Engine Console is developed mostly with Firefox on Linux, so if you notice
        a bug with another browser, please notify me.)
